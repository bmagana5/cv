                    <p><em>Just a fella trying to get out of my almost-in-my-30s-and-no-job rut by learning how to program.</em></p>
                    <p>
                        Where to start... I'm Brian, I was born and raised in and around Bakersfield, CA. I went to the local community college
                        here and earned my AA in Music. Earning that was one of the most fulfilling and enriching things I could've done for 
                        myself, despite having no desire to pursue higher education after high school, initially. I married my high school 
                        sweetheart and we've been together almost 11 years now, amazing years, might I add. I pursued a degree in computer science 
                        at the Cal State here, but I was unsuccessful in completing that despite learning a great deal about how computers work. I wish 
                        to go back and ultimately complete and earn my degree, but perhaps in a few years. For now, I'll simply stick to learning about 
                        software development and coding in Python and maybe some Web Development. Maybe, some day, I'll be able to start a career in this 
                        field.
